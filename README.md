# HawaiiEnergy
First, I analyze solar energy potential in Hawaii using 20 years of solar irradiation data provided by NREL. Next, with EIA 
data, I compare various energy related metrics such as C02 emmisions, solar generation, and electricity prices in Hawaii 
with the rest of the United States. These finding are communicated visually using Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
